            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>many of that Order have not the, Advantage or the Opportunity to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this Knowledge from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Authors, and therefore are forced to ſeek it in the Roman Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Councils, and the Modern Historians of that Church: Where every thing is miſrepreſented and placed in ſo Falſe a Light, that its hard to find out what is Truth. Some of the genuine Remains of Antiquity they have concealed, but they have falſified and altered more, and added ſo much to the Primitive Records, eſpecially in the first Four Centuries, that near Three Parts of Four (both in <hi>Baronius</hi> and the <hi>Councils</hi>) are modern Forgeries, manifest Legends, and impertinent Excurſions into Sophiſtical Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the later Doctrins and
<pb facs="tcp:200298:2"/> Practices of <hi>Rome.</hi> It would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be a Work worthy of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Church in ſo Learned an Age, to make an acurate Collection of that, and only that which is true and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the Primitive Hiſtory and Councils. 'Tis true, divers Eminent Men have made ſome ſteps toward it; but it is too great an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking for any One Man to accompliſh, as appears by that generous Project of Dr. <hi>Thomas James,</hi> Propoſed to the Moſt Learned Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to employ a Select Company of both <hi>Univerſities,</hi> with due Aſſistances and Encouragement for the perfecting this Deſign: Wherefore in the mean time, it may be ſerviceable to gather together ſome Materials for ſo Noble a purpoſe, and that firſt encouraged me to make theſe Obſervations as I
<pb facs="tcp:200298:3"/> was Reading the <hi>Annals</hi> of <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> with the <hi>Councils:</hi> Which I have (by the Advice of ſome of my Friends) Methodically digeſted in this little Tract; and I hope it may be uſeful, not only to direct ſuch as apply themſelves to this kind of Study, but alſo to confirm others of Our own Communion in their firm Adherence to their Excellent Religion, when they ſee ſo many plain Evidences, That all the <hi>Roman Churches</hi> Pretences to Antiquity (both in Doctrin and Worſhip) are founded on, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by little elſe, but thoſe <hi>Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Corruptions,</hi> by which they Impoſed upon the Ignorant and Eaſie World for Six or Seven <hi>Centuries</hi> together. Theſe Pious Frauds (as They counted them) did indeed then advance their Intereſt, and establiſh
<pb facs="tcp:200298:3"/> their Errors; but now when they are detected by this Diſcerning Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they prove their utter Shame; and did not Secular Advantages and Implicit Faith, or Fear and Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hinder thoſe under their Yoke from being acquainted, or however from owning theſe unfaithful Actings of their Spiritual Guides; Theſe Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries would not only ſecure Our People, but make many Converts from Them.</p>

            <p>WHen <hi>Campian</hi> long ago undertook to defend the Roman Cauſe, he boaſted, that <hi>He was ſtrengthned with the firm and powerful Guard of all the Councils, and that all the General Councils were on his ſide</hi>

But he that with Judgment and Diligence ſhall peruſe their own allowed Editions of the <hi>Councils,</hi> will eaſily diſcover the falſhood of this Aſſertion: For there is ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But theſe Corruptions are carried on with ſuch Confidence and Cunning, that an unexepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced and unwary Student, may be impoſed on by this ſpecious ſhew of Venerable Antiquity: For their ſakes therefore, it's neceſſary to take a ſhort view of that Fraud and Policy, which is ſo commonly made uſe of in thoſe Editions of the Councils which paſs through the Roman Mint, eſpecially in thoſe which are in moſt uſe among us, <hi>viz.</hi> The Edition of <hi>Severinus Binius</hi>

               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Edit. <hi>Lab.</hi> &amp; <hi>Coſſart. Paris,</hi> An. 1671.</note>, wherein <hi>Binius</hi> his Notes are printed <hi>verbatim.</hi> Which uſeful deſign was begun by a Learned and Ingenious Gentleman, in a Tract entituled <hi>Roman Forgeries,</hi> printed at <hi>London, An. 1673:</hi> But that Author doth not follow the exact order of Time, nor doth he go much beyond the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, and even in that Period he left out many plain Inſtances; And whereas he died, before he had proceeded any further; I reſolved to begin where he left off: But for Methods ſake, and to make this Diſcourſe more entire, I have begun with the firſt <hi>Century,</hi> and ſo proceeded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the order of the ſeveral Councils (only writing more briefly upon the Three firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> which were largely treated of in that Author before) deducing the account of theſe Impoſtures down to the end of the Fourth <hi>Century,</hi> and ſhewing (as I go along) what Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices have been uſed by the Editors and Annotator to dreſs up theſe Ancient Evidences, ſo as to make them look favourably upon their great <hi>Diana,</hi> the <hi>Supremacy</hi> and other Corruptions of the Roman Church. To this end they have publiſhed many ſpurious Councils, many counterfeit Canons and forged Decretals; and for ſuch as are genuine, they have frequently altered the Text, both by Additions and Diminutions, and have ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed the Senſe by partial and fallacious Notes, that it will be evident (by the Remarks here made upon them) their buſineſs in the publiſhing theſe Volumes, was not to promote the Truth, but to ſerve a Party. Nor can any thing elſe be expected from <hi>Binius</hi> his Notes, which (as he owns in his Preface) <hi>He took out of</hi> Baronius, Bellarmin <hi>and</hi> Poſſevin: <hi>The deſign of which three Men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Richerius</hi> an ingenuous <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> Doctor) <hi>is evident to all Men to have been no other, but to prove the Pope was appointed by
<pb facs="tcp:200298:5"/> Chriſt to be the abſolute Monarch, and Infallible Judge of his Church</hi>

                  <hi>Richer.</hi> Praef. ad hiſt. Concil. pag. 4.</note>. And ſince the Notes chiefly follow <hi>Baronius,</hi> we have, as we go along, in every Period noted ſeveral of the deſigned Falſhoods, and of the Contradictions, Errors and Miſtakes in his <hi>Annals.</hi> Which Hiſtory is ſo full of Forgeries, falſe Quotations, and feigned Tales to ſet up the Credit of the Roman Church, and its corrupt Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and Practices, that to diſcover them all would require almoſt as many Volumes as his <hi>Annals</hi> make: So that we muſt content our ſelves with ſome of the plaineſt Inſtances which fall into this Matter of the Councils, and will ſet them in a clear Light, and ſhew they are as contrary to Reaſon, as they are to true Hiſtory. Which <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking we hope will be many ways uſeful: Firſt, It will tend to the eaſe of thoſe who intend to read over the Tomes of the <hi>Councils,</hi> or the Annals of <hi>Baronius,</hi> and ſave them much time and pains by preſenting the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Errors of thoſe great Volumes at one View, which they would ſpend a long time in ſearching after, if they were to gather them up as they lye diſperſed. Secondly, It may be very uſeful to thoſe who deſire to be rightly informed in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies between us and the Roman Church, becauſe it will give them a clear proſpect of what <hi>Councils</hi> and other Antiquities are Authentic, and may be allowed for Evidence in this Diſpute; wherein our Adverſaries have ſo little regard to their own Honour, that generally one half of their Evidence is ſuch as they have either forged or corrupted. Thirdly, It will be neceſſary (by way of Antidote) to prepare thoſe, who by reading Books ſo full of Infection, may by theſe plauſible Falſifications be in
<pb facs="tcp:200298:6"/> danger to be ſeduced into a great eſteem of the Opinions and Practices of the Roman Church; when they find ſo many ſeemingly ancient Tracts and Councils brought in to juſtifie her in all things, and ſee (by this falſe Light) all Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory and Records ſo modelled, as to perſwade their Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, That in the pureſt Chriſtian Times, all things were believed and done in the Catholic Church juſt as they are now at <hi>Rome.</hi> But when it ſhall appear, that all this is a continued Series and train of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, it will render their Notions and Practices, not only ſuſpected, but odious, as needing ſuch vile and baſe Artifices, to make them ſeem agreeable to true Antiquity.</p>
            <p>To this it may be Objected, That divers of the Modern Writers of this Church, and eſpecially the moſt Learned, do now own divers of theſe Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which we here detect to have been ſpurious, and therefore it ſeems needleſs to prove that which they have already granted us. I reply, That none of them own all theſe Corruptions, and divers of their Authors cite them very confidently to this very day, and ſtill the things themſelves ſtand in their moſt approved Editions of <hi>Councils,</hi> and the Remarks are only in Marginal Notes. But ſince they were believed in thoſe Ages, while their <hi>Supremacy</hi> and other Novel Doctrins were ſetting up, and were urged for good Proofs, till theſe Opinions had taken root; it is not ſatisfaction enough to renounce that Evidence, of which they now have no more need, unleſs they diſclaim the Doctrins alſo to which they firſt gave Credit: And till they do this, it is fit the World ſhould know by what Falſe-Evidence they firſt gained theſe Points. For, if a Man ſhould get an
<pb facs="tcp:200298:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> Eſtate by Bribing his Jury and his Witneſſes, it is not enough for him to confeſs theſe Perſons were Suborned, unleſs he reſtore the Ill-gotten Lands; and till he reſtore them, he ought to be upbraided with his Bribery, even after he hath acknowledged it. Secondly, It may be alledged, That <hi>Junius, River</hi> and <hi>Daillé</hi> abroad; <hi>Perkins, Cook</hi> and <hi>James</hi> at home; have taken great pains on this Subject, and that the Learned Author of the <hi>Hiſtorical Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Authority of General Councils,</hi> printed at <hi>London, 1688.</hi> hath already handled this Argument. I Anſwer, That the Six former are chiefly concerned in the Tracts of particular <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> and make few Remarks on the <hi>Councils:</hi> The laſt indeed keeps cloſe to the Great <hi>Councils,</hi> but paſſes over the Small ones; and any who compares this Diſcourſe with that, will find the Deſign, the Method and Inſtances ſo different, that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe will ſtill be uſeful in its kind, as that will be alſo: For here, in an acurate Order, all the Frauds of that Church are put together throughout every <hi>Century,</hi> not only what have been obſerved by others, but many now firſt taken notice of, and not obſerved before. And indeed, the Inſtances of theſe Frauds are ſo many, that we have been forced to give but brief Touches upon divers of the Particulars, and could neither enlarge upon ſingle Inſtances, nor adorn the Style; our buſineſs being chiefly to direct the younger Students in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity;</hi> and if our Remarks be but ſo clear as to be underſtood by, and uſeful to them, we have our Aim. And it is hoped this may ſuffice to prove, That the genuine Records of <hi>Councils</hi> do condemn the Modern Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, Worſhip and Diſcipline of the Roman Church,
<pb facs="tcp:200298:7"/> and that whatever in theſe Editions of them ſeems to countenance thoſe things, are Forgeries and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions deviſed on purpoſe to ſet a falſe gloſs upon their Modern Inventions. The Methodical Diſcovery whereof may convince any unprejudiced Man, That Ours is the truly Ancient and Catholic Religion, and Theirs a Device of later times, which cannot be rendred any way agreeable to the Primitive Writings, without innumerable Impoſtures and Falſifications.</p>

'Tis certain the Greek Clergy are Married and cohabit with their Wives, according to this Apoſtolical Canon, and the Fifteenth Canon of the Sixth General Council: And it is not unpleaſant to obſerve, That theſe Notes cite the Second Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> to prove there were no Canons made in the Sixth General Council; yet that very <hi>Nicene</hi> Council often Quotes, and highly approves the 82d Canon of the Sixth General Council, as giving ſome Countenance to their Image-Worſhip.

                  <p>The 17th Canon ſaith, <hi>He that keeps a Concubine ſhall not be in any Order of the Clergy.</hi> The Notes cite ſome of their Doctors, who affirm, <hi>That this Crime doth not make a Clerk irregular</hi>

                  <p>Laſtly the 84th Canon gives us a Canon of Scripture, which doth not agree with the <hi>Trent</hi> Canon, for it rejects <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> from being Canonical, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not <hi>Wiſdom, Tobit, Judith,</hi> nor (in Old Copies<note n="(r)" place="margin">Dr. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:200298:10"/> Authentic Record of the true and genuine Books of Holy Scripture, but the Romaniſts reject it, as being a good evidence againſt their New <hi>Trent</hi> Canon.</p>

Now though it he ſo apparent and undeniable, that theſe Epiſtles are Forged, and conſequently of no Authority; yet the Roman Church hath made great uſe of them in the Ignorant Ages: For <hi>Binius</hi> notes all along in his Margen, what Sections of them are tranſcribed into their Canon Law; and even in later times their Writers againſt the Proteſtants do commonly cite their Infamous Impoſtures, to prove the Supremacy of the Pope, his Infallibility, and right to Appeals; as alſo for the exemption of the Clergy, their Celibacy and Habits, and to prove <hi>their Maſs with its Ceremonies, Auricular Confeſſion, Apocryphal Books, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Chriſm, Veneration of Relicks and Martyrs, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> in his <hi>Cenſura Patrum,</hi> hath noted the ſeveral Epiſtles, and the Authors which cite them, ſaving us the labour of inſtancing: And therefore we will only make a few general Obſervations upon this matter, and ſo diſmiſs theſe Forgeries.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. I. That ſince the Romaniſts have no other genuine Ancient Authors, to prove theſe New-Doctrines and Practices by; but are forced generally to place theſe apparent Forgeries in the Fore-front of all their Authorities, we may conclude theſe Points of their Religion are all Innovations, unheard of in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Ages; ſo that <hi>Iſidore</hi> was forced to invent theſe Epiſtles almoſt 800 years after Chriſt, to give ſome ſhew of Antiquity to them; and theſe Points were in thoſe Ignorant-Times miſtaken by this means for Primitive Uſages and Opinions, and ſo got footing in the World under that diſguiſe; but now that the Fallacy is diſcovered, the Doctrines and Practices ought to be diſowned as well, as the Epiſtles on which they are built.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv II. There are many other Points of the Roman Religion, which are not ſo much as mentioned in any of theſe Forged Epiſtles, ſuch as <hi>Worſhip of Images, Formal Praying to the Saints, and to the Virgin</hi> Mary; <hi>Tranſubſtantiation, Half-Communion, and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:200298:19"/> of the Hoſt, Purgatory, Indulgences, and Justification by Merits,</hi> with ſome others. Now theſe are ſo New, that in <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s time, when he invented theſe Epiſtles they were not heard of nor received, no not in the Roman Church; for if they had, no doubt this Impoſtor, who was ſo zealous to get Credit for all the Opinions and Uſages of that Church which he knew of, would have made ſome Popes write Epiſtles to juſtifie theſe alſo, and his ſilence concerning them makes it more than probable, that theſe were all invented ſince the year of Chriſt 800.</p>
                  <p>Obſerv. III. Though the later Romaniſts frequently cite theſe Forged <hi>Decretals,</hi> yet no genuine Author or Hiſtorian for Seven hundred years after Chriſt did ever Quote or Mention them, no not ſo much as any of the Popes themſelves in all that Period. Now it is morally impoſſible ſo many important Points ſhould be ſo clearly decided by ſo many Ancient Biſhops of ſo Famous a Church, and yet no Author ever take notice of it. And doubtleſs when the Popes attempted to be Supreme, and claimed Appeals about the year 400, <hi>Zoſimus</hi> and <hi>Boniface,</hi> who quarrelled with the Eaſtern and <hi>African</hi> Biſhops about theſe Points, and were ſo hard put to it for Evidence, as to feign ſome private Canons were made at the firſt general Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> would certainly have cited theſe Epiſtles, which are ſo clear Evidence for their pretences, if they had either ſeen or heard of them; but they do not once name them in all that Controverſie, which ſhews they were not then in being; yea, thoſe who know Church Hiſtory, do clearly diſcern, that the main Points ſetled by theſe Epiſtles, were things diſputed of about the Seventh and Eighth Centuries, a little before <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s time; and therefore theſe Forgeries muſt never be cited for to prove any Point to be Ancient or Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>

Though the Inventer of theſe Epiſtles was ſo zealous a Bigot for the Roman Cauſe, yet many things are to be found in them, which contradict the preſent Tenents of that Church.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:200298:30"/> and at this rate the Pope would have laied two years at leaſt in his Apoſtacy, which the Annotator muſt not endure. To conclude, we now ſee, <hi>That a Council held no body knows where nor when, concealed from all Ancient Authors, writ in later times, full of Barbariſms, and Non-ſenſe, Falſhoods and contradictions,</hi> if it do but pretend to make out the Supremacy and Infallibity of the Pope, and ſet him (while he was an Apoſtate and falſly denied the Fact,) above a Council of Three hundred Innocent Biſhops; if it do but ſay the Pope, though never ſo wicked, cannot be judged by any but himſelf: This Council ſhall be publiſhed by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Editors, and vindicated by partial Notes, as if it were a moſt genuine and Authentic Truth: From whence it is plain, That theſe Editors, and eſpecially this Annotator hath no other meaſure of Truth and Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but the Intereſt of the Roman Church, which they reſolve to promote, though it be by the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt means.

And though <hi>Baronius</hi>'s and <hi>Binius</hi>'s Notes, deny this Seven years Vacancy, it is upon meer Conjectures: The Scandal of ſo long a Vacancy no doubt, ſetting ſome of the old Paraſites of <hi>Rome</hi> on work, to invent two Popes Names and put them into the Liſt, from whence probably they have been foiſted into <hi>Optatus</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> two Latin Fathers, while the Greek Authors (which theſe Forgers Underſtood not) do continue Uncorrupted: And truly nothing but the Names of theſe two Popes remain; for no good Hiſtorian mentions any one Eminent Act done by either of them; however, the Annotator had rather fill up his Scene with empty Names of Feigned Popes, who did nothing for Seven years together, than let the Reader ſuppoſe the Catholic Church could ſo long want its pretended Head. But though the Notes allow not the Authority of the <hi>Pontifical</hi> for the Vacancy, they truſt it for the fictitious Story of this <hi>Marcellus</hi> his Life, and would have us believe, That in a time of Perſecution this Pope appointed Twenty five Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> to Baptize Converts and Bury Martyrs in; and though the Laws and Cuſtoms of that City then, forbad to Bury dead Bodies within the Walls, we are to believe that the Tyrant <hi>Maxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> (who made all theſe Martyrs, and perſecuted this very Pope) conſented to his breaking this Ancient Law.

                  <p>Secondly, This Fable chiefly relies on the Credit of the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> (ſo often proved falſe) and upon the repute of <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Acts: But the Annotator at firſt ominouſly Charges them both with Falſhood<note n="(w)" place="margin">

                  <p>Thirdly, The Notes ſay not only the Acts of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi> but <hi>Zoſimus</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> do both atteſt this Story: Now firſt, <hi>Zoſimus</hi> was a Pagan, and <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi> confeſs, He tells many Malicious Lies of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> for ſuppreſſing the Heathen Religion; and though they confute the reſt of his Calumnies, they defend his Relation of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Baptiſm, as ſounding ſomething like thoſe forged Acts<note n="(y)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 324. §. 17.</note>; and though his Account of it reflect as much upon <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> as is poſſible; yet the Annaliſt and Annotator labour to prove this Spightful Heathen to be a truer Hiſtorian, than <hi>Sozomen, Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Euſebius,</hi> whom they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as Lyars and Flatterers, not to be believed againſt <hi>Zoſimus.</hi> Yet there is a mighty difference between this Pagan's Hiſtory of the Baptiſm of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and that in <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Acts: <hi>Zoſimus</hi> ſaith, It was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> named <hi>Aegyptius,</hi> lately by the Court Ladies brought acquainted with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who adviſed him to be Baptized; and this the Notes ſay was <hi>Hoſius;</hi> yet it is plain, <hi>Hoſius</hi> was <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Intimate Friend, and his Legate into <hi>Egypt</hi> Twelve years before <hi>(z).</hi> Beſides,<note n="(x)" place="margin">

                     <hi>Zoſimus</hi> doth not name <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> and only deſigned by his Relation to blacken <hi>Constantine,</hi> and repreſent Chriſtianity as a Sanctuary for Villanies, which could not be expiated among the Pagans: But the Acts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a Perſecution, and a Leproſie, and make <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the Adviſers of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Baptiſm; and their buſineſs is only to ſet up <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Name. And the Stories (like all Falſhoods) do not hang toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As for <hi>Sozomen,</hi> he is no Evidence for <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Acts, nor doth he once name that Pope in the place cited<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sozom.</hi> hiſt lib. 1. cap. 5.</note>. He only confutes the ſcandalous Stories, which <hi>Zoſimus</hi> had falſly told of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſhewing how improbable it is, that this Emperor (after he had Reigned nigh Twenty years) ſhould need a New
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:200298:39"/> Converſion; and how unlikely it muſt be, that the Pagans would not have found out ſome Rites to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate him, that ſo they might ſecure him in their Religion: So that he is a Witneſs, That theſe Reports of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> were falſe, and invented by Malicious Heathens, and ſo far as <hi>Zoſimus</hi> and <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Acts agree, he confutes them both; and ſince he lived within an Hundred years after this time, while ſome alive might poſſibly remember theſe Paſſages; His early denial of theſe Fictions is better Evidence againſt them, than <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Binius</hi>'s Teſtimony for them, after Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years; to ſerve a Turn, and do Honour to that Church they reſolve to Magnifie.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Notes ſpeak of <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Returning to <hi>Rome</hi> in great glory; which is not mentioned in <hi>Zoſimus</hi> nor <hi>Sozomen,</hi> and only relies on the Credit of theſe Acts<note n="(b)" place="margin">

But the very Acts declare, That <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> (who had Built and Adorned ſo many Churches, and if Images or Pictures had then been uſed, muſt have ſeen the Faces of S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi>) did not know the Faces of theſe two great Apoſtles, till <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> ſhewed them their Images. Whence we infer, That the Acts are no good Proof for Images, if they were Authentic; and their being firſt cited in an Ignorant Council, made up of Forgeries and Falſe Stories, gives us good Reaſon to believe them Spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p n="8">§. 8. The Annotator in the next place aſſerts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, That <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was Baptized at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Sylveſter, Anno</hi> 324<note n="(c)" place="margin">

Thirdly, <hi>Zoſimus</hi> is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Lying Writer, as to <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> and though he do ſay, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was Baptized at <hi>Rome,</hi> he doth not affirm, that <hi>Sylveſter</hi> Baptized him: Fourthly, <hi>Sozomen</hi> only relates <hi>Zoſimus</hi> his Story to confute it; ſo that not one of his Witneſſes do prove the matter: Yet theſe Authors with a weak Conjecture, That <hi>Conſtantine</hi> could not have been preſent in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, if he had not been Baptized before (which we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently confute) is all the Evidence that <hi>Baronius</hi> and theſe Notes can give for this incredible Story: But on the other ſide, there are many clear Proofs, that he was baptized at <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a little before his death.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Euſebius</hi> (who lived at that time, and knew <hi>Constantine</hi> very well, and writ his Hiſtory ſoon after) doth affirm this: And if it had been Falſe, many then alive who could remember it, would doubtleſs have expoſed him for ſo manifeſt a Fiction. The Notes ſay he Forged this Story in favour of <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> but he muſt be very Ridiculous, if he would be obliged by a Story of his Father, which many hundreds as well as himſelf, muſt have then known to be a Falſhood; And <hi>Euſebius</hi> muſt be as ſilly as he was knaviſh, to invent a Fable ſo eaſy to be diſproved by living Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: But the Notes wrong <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when they ſay, <hi>he</hi> reports <hi>that</hi> Conſtantine <hi>died Impious and alienated from</hi> the <hi>Catholic Church;</hi> For <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith he made a moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Pious end: However <hi>Euſebius</hi> by this Teſtimony brings upon himſelf, all the Rage and Spite of <hi>Baronius</hi> and our Annotator, who upon all occaſions Blaſt this Holy and Learned Writer, to whoſe pains they and all the Chriſtian World are infinitely beholding; and though while <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s Hiſtory continues, it be almoſt the only

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:200298:46"/> Martyrs.</hi> To which I Anſwer, firſt, It is falſe (as was ſhewed) that the former Canon receives the Worſhip of any Martyrs, true or falſe. Secondly, Why doth not this Canon call theſe <hi>Pſeudo-Angels,</hi> as the former called thoſe it rejected, <hi>Pſeudo-Martyrs,</hi> if the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions were of the ſame kind?

And <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſhews, That it was thoſe Angels, who gave the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which were hereby forbid to be Prayed to; and I hope neither <hi>Binius,</hi> nor his Maſter, will ſay, theſe were Devils: Wherefore this Canon plainly ſaith, <hi>Praying to good Angels,</hi> (as They of <hi>Rome</hi> now do) <hi>is Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, The Sixtieth Canon of this Council, is the moſt ancient Account of the Canon of Scripture, that ever was made by any Chriſtian Synod, being the ſame which the Church of <hi>England</hi> holds at this day; for it leaves out all thoſe Books of <hi>Judith, Tobit, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, &amp;c.</hi> which we account not to be Canonical; but our Annotator finding ſo Primitive a Council con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting their new <hi>Trent</hi> Canon, and not being able to reconcile the difference, paſſeth this remarkable Canon by, without any Note.</p>
                  <p n="16">§. 16.

                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 324. §. 117.</note>; yet at laſt, to ſecure their Retreat from ſo indefenſible a Poſt, He and the Annotator make it a Fiction of the poor Greeks: I ſhall therefore, Firſt, prove it a Forgery; and, Secondly, make it out, That not the Greeks, but the Pope's Creatures deviſed it. Firſt, That it is a Fiction appears from divers Arguments: For, Firſt, who can believe <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> ſo unjuſt, firſt, to give <hi>Rome</hi> and the Weſtern Empire to the Pope, and then to one of his Sons? Or who can think the Pope ſo tame never to put in his Claim? Secondly, This Edict
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:200298:47"/> is grounded on the idle Story of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Baptiſm by <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> which out of <hi>Sylveſter</hi>'s Fabulous Acts is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated at large in it; but thoſe Acts being (as was ſhewed) a meer Forgery, this Edict muſt be ſo alſo. Thirdly, It repreſents <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who was born and brought up under Chriſtian Parents, and had ſetled Chriſtianity before this, as a meer Heathen, till he met with <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter</hi> at this time. Fourthly, It pretends the whole Senate and all the Nobles joyned with the Emperor, to give the Pope this Power. But beſides the folly of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s delegating more Power than ever he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had, it is moſt falſe to ſuppoſe, That the whole Senate at this time were Chriſtians; for many of them continued Pagans long after <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s Death. <hi>Baronius</hi> indeed (out of <hi>Sylvester</hi>'s Acts) affirms, <hi>That none of the Senate was converted before the Year</hi> 324<note n="(t)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baron.</hi> An. 324. §. 76.</note>. Forgetting that he had told us, <hi>Divers Senators had given up their Names to Chriſt Twelve years before</hi>
                     <note n="(u)" place="margin">Id. An. 312. §. 75, &amp; 76.</note>; and that one or both of the Conſuls were Chriſtians two years before this<note n="(w)" place="margin">Id. An. 322. §. 1.</note>. So ill a Memory had the great Cardinal, when his Cauſe obliged him to defend a Lye. Fifthly, It ſpeaks of the Emperor's intending to build a City, and call it by his own Name, in the Province of <hi>Bizantium,</hi> and his Reſolution to transfer his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire thither; and yet before this, the Edict had reckoned up <hi>Constantinople</hi> by name, and <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> as two of the Five Patriarchates, and given <hi>Rome</hi> Juriſdiction over all the other Four. Laſtly, It is Dated in the Fourth Conſulſhip of <hi>Constantine</hi> with <hi>Gallicanus,</hi> whereas <hi>Licinius</hi> was his Collegue in his Fourth Conſulſhip, which was in the Year of Chriſt 315, that is, Nine years before the time fixed by <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> for this pretended Baptiſm; and that clearly ſhews the Story to be all Sham, as all modeſt and learned Men of the Roman Church do now acknowledge: But <hi>Baronius,</hi> and our Annota<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or, conſidering not barely the falſhood of this Edict, (for that alone would not diſcourage them;) but obſerving alſo, that it deſtroys the pretended Divine Right of the Pope's
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:200298:47"/> Supremacy, grant it at laſt to be a Forgery, but ſay, It was deviſed by the Greeks. Secondly, Therefore I ſhall ſhew the Falſhood of that Accuſation: For, Firſt, they charge <hi>Balſamon</hi> with publiſhing it; Now he did not write till <hi>An.</hi> 1180, yet the Notes out of <hi>Baronius</hi> do confeſs, that a Pope quoted it <hi>An.</hi> 1054, (that is, near an Hundred years before <hi>Balſamen</hi> was born) to juſtifie his Superiority over the Greek Church; and therefore <hi>Balſamon</hi> was not the Inventer of it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, It doth the Greeks no good, for it gives the Pope power over all their Patriarchs, and reckons <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> as the laſt and loweſt Patriarchate, ſo that the Forger could not come out of that Church. Thirdly, It is grounded on the fabulous Acts of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi> writ in Latin, and feigned in the Weſtern World; and its whole deſign is to advance the Pope above all Biſhops, Kings, and Emperors; and therefore no doubt it was advanced by a Friend of the Popes. Fourthly, The Notes confeſs, <hi>That a Pope firſt ſet up this Edict, to prove his Univerſal Supremacy,</hi> (not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering with <hi>Baronius,</hi> it ſeems, that it weakened his Title) <hi>and the grave and learned Men of the Roman Church received it as Authentic for many Ages after.</hi> We add, That till the Reformation they cited it, and writ in defence of it; and though now their Point is gained they begin to renounce it, yet the Advantage that Church got by it, ſhews, that they were the Forgers of it; yea, it ſeems <hi>Anno</hi> 1339 one <hi>Johannes Diaconus,</hi> a Member of the Roman Church, was thought to be the Author of it. Fifthly, Whoever conſiders how unwilling the Cardinal and our Annotator are to have it clearly re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But there is full Evidence, that <hi>theſe Suburbicarian Regions were only thoſe Provinces which

As to the Edition of <hi>Gelaſius Cyzicenus,</hi> it is generally a very modeſt account of this Council, and hath not many Errors in it, but like all other ancient Authors it ſpeaks very little of the Pope; for which Reaſon <hi>Binius</hi> claps it under Hatches, and will not produce it till the latter end of his Second Tome after the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to convince us, That all Authors are valued or ſlighted meerly as they promote or diſcourage the Uſurpations of <hi>Rome.</hi>

As to the Canons, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus</hi> made no objection againſt them in his time, and it is very certain that the Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> after this Council, always had the ſecond place. For as the firſt General Council at <hi>Nice</hi> gave old <hi>Rome</hi> the firſt place, as being the Imperial City; ſo this ſecond General Council doubted not, but when <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> was become new <hi>Rome,</hi> and an Imperial City alſo; they had power to give it the ſecond place, and ſuitable Priviledges.

Yea, in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> it is declared, That the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ought to have had the ſecond place in the Factious Synod at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and he is reckoned in that fourth General Council next after the Pope, whoſe Legates were there, and yet durſt not deny him the ſecond place, in which he ſat and ſubſcribed in that order, having firſt had this Canon confirmed at <hi>Chalcedon:</hi> So that all Churches, but that of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſubmit to this General Council; and they who pretend moſt to venerate them, do deſpiſe and reject the Authority of General Councils, if they oppoſe the ends of their Pride and Avarice. To conclude, Here is a General Council called and confirmed only by the Emperour, aſſembled without the Pope or his Legates, decreeing Matters of Faith and of Diſcipline, yet every where owned and received as genuine, except at <hi>Rome,</hi> when Intereſt made them partial, and ſtill no leſs valued for that by all other Churches: Which gives a ſevere Blow to the modern Pretences of their Papal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and Infallibility.</p>

Again, he fooliſhly attempts to prove, Clergy-men ought not to Marry, because S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thoſe that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;</hi> and though he confeſs it was uſual for many Clergy-men to live with their Wives, he calls that cohabitation, <hi>the being polluted with carnal Concupiſcence,</hi> in his 4th Epiſtle: So that he is juſtly taxed with ſpeaking profanely of God's holy Ordinance, and of contradicting S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who excepted not the Clergy, when he ſaid, <hi>Marriage is honourable in all me, and the Bed undefiled,</hi> Hebr.

And every one may ſee, that this Council was directed to mark this Decree principally by S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Advice, and ſecondarily by the Popes; for at that time <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Fame and Intereſt was greater than that of <hi>Siricius;</hi> yet after all, the Council decreed this, not by the Authority of either of theſe Biſhops (as the Notes
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:200298:79"/> pretend,) but only by their Information, and upon their Advice by theſe Letters, which were not firſt read (as they pretend) but after four other buſineſſes were diſpatched.</p>

And it is plain, the whole Canon is falſly placed in this Council under <hi>Siricius,</hi> becauſe Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> (who came not into the Papacy till above twenty years after) is named in it as Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet after all theſe devices, it doth not declare what Books are ſtrictly Canonical, and ſo will not juſtifie the Decree at <hi>Trent.</hi> Fourthly, In the 48th Canon of the Latin Verſion, the Council agrees to adviſe about the Donatiſts, with <hi>Siricius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Simplicianus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> not giving any more deference to one of theſe Biſhops than to the other, but looking on them as equally fit to adviſe them: Yet the Notes boldly ſay, <hi>They adviſe with the Pope, becauſe they knew he preſided, as a Biſhop and Doctor, over the Catholic Church; but with the Biſhop of</hi> Milan <hi>only, as a Man every where famous for his Learning</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:200298:80"/> had any Authority over them, only they deſired their advice joyntly, as being both Eminent and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Biſhops, and their prohibiting Appeals ſhews, they knew nothing of the Popes preſiding over the Catholic Church.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX CONCERNING BARONIUS HIS ANNALS.</head>
            <p n="1">§. 1. THE large and elaborate Volumes of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> are the main Guide to the Editors and Annotator: From him they take the Dates of all Councils, and out of him they have added divers new Synods not extant in the older Editions of the Councils, of which they can ſay no more, than to abbreviate <hi>Baronius:</hi> From him they borrow moſt of their plauſible Notes, by which they either paint over that which ſeems for the Intereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> or diſparage what makes againſt it; and therefore we have had often occaſion to diſcover his Fallacies in all that part of his Annals which concerns the Councils; but there are many other notorious
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:200298:83"/> Frauds and manifeſt Falſhoods in that Author, of which I ſhall here give ſome few Inſtances, which may ſerve as a Caution to all that read his Hiſtory, and alſo as a Direction by which they may in other Centuries find out his manifold Errours; and I ſhall confine the Examples here produced to the Fourth Century, becauſe that is the moſt largely treated of in this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>It is evident, that all the Writers of the Roman ſide, for many Ages have deſigned to impoſe upon the World; in that, their Diſputants, their Publiſhers of Councils, and Hiſtorians do all agree; for their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Practices cannot be maintained by plain Truth. The Methods uſed by <hi>Baronius,</hi> in his Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Annals (which he writ purely to ſerve the Intereſt of the Roman Church) may be reduced to theſe Heads:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> His frequent quoting Forged and Spurious Tracts; ſuch as the <hi>Pontifical,</hi> the Acts of the Martyrs, the Eccleſiaſtical Tables (that is, the Roman <hi>Miſſal</hi> and <hi>Martyrology</hi>) with other late and fabulous Writers, ſuch as <hi>Nicephorus, Simeon, Metaphrastes, Laurentius Surius, &amp;c.</hi> And the Reader ſhall find, he very ſeldom cites any other Authors to prove the Great Actions of Primitive Popes, or the dignity of the Roman Church, and its pretended Priviledges: As alſo to make out the Miracles done by many of their Saints, and to be evidence for <hi>the Invocation of Saints, Praying for the Dead, Worſhiping the Croſs, Relicks and Images;</hi> for <hi>the Merits of Celibacy and Holineſs of Monks,</hi> or other Superſtitions. Some Examples of which in the Fourth Century are theſe: He cites the Acts of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi> which he confeſſeth need amending, to prove <hi>the Adoration of the Croſs</hi>

            <pb n="175" facs="tcp:200298:93"/>
            <p>And now by theſe few Inſtances, within the compaſs of one Century, the Reader may judge what Truth there can be in that Religion, that needs ſo many Frauds to hide its Faults; and what truſt can be given to that Hiſtorian, who to ſerve an ill Cauſe, makes no ſcruple to uſe all theſe kinds of Deceit. This may warn all that deſign to peruſe theſe <hi>Annals,</hi> not to rely upon any of his Authorities or Arguments without examining, and alſo not to take every thing for Primitive and Ancient, which he pretends to be ſo. This may ſuffice for this Volume, and (if we proceed) we ſhall make the like Remarks on the following Tomes; to ſhew, that their Religion is made up of Falſhoods, and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended without Lying and Forgery, which is the great ſupport of their Evil Cauſe.</p>
